To perform the code the main command line display should be ./gradlew run --args= followed by one of these prompts in quotation marks as shown:
1."-r inputdata.csv -d"
           
2."-g -d"                                
           
3."-g -w outputdata.csv"                 
           
4."-r inputdata.csv -w outputdata.csv"   

The main input file is called input.csv, however the output file can be called anything you'd like.
